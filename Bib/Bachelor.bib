abstract = {Zur Digitalisierung von Diensten und Prozessen besitzt die Blockchain-Techno- logie eine gro{\ss}e Relevanz für viele verschiedene Anwendungsbereiche au{\ss}er- halb der Finanzbranche und vor allem auch unabhängig von Kryptowährungen. Während für das Internet der Dinge vor allem die mit Smart Contracts verbun- denen Automatisierungspotenziale wesentlich sind, ist es für Anwendungen aus den Bereichen Supply Chain oder für Herkunftsnachweise die Irreversibilität der verwalteten Transaktionen. Der Beitrag beschreibt die Funktionsweise dieser neuen Technologie und die sich daraus ergebenden wichtigsten Eigenschaften. Zur Identi kation von Digitalisierungsvorhaben, für die die Blockchain-Techno- logie geeignet ist, liefert das Kapitel eine Kriterienliste. Die Breite der Blockchain-Technologien und ihre Anwendungen erfordern einen multidisziplinären Ansatz sowohl bei der Entwicklung der Basistechnologien als auch bei der Anwendungsentwicklung, der Wirtschaftlichkeitsberechnung und der Konzeption neuer Governance-Modelle. Die vielfältigen Kompetenzen der Fraunhofer-Institute ermöglichen der Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, einen wesent- lichen Beitrag bei der Weiterentwicklung und Anwendung der Blockchain-Tech- nologie zu leisten.},

abstract = {GraphQL, a data query language that provides an alternative to REST and ad-hoc webservice architectures, is the most revolutionary technology for data fetching since Ajax. Just as React has changed the way web developers approach UI, GraphQL will change the way web developers work with data over HTTP. This practical guide simplifies the process of getting started with this language. Alex Banks and Eve Porcello, software engineers/architects and instructors, start with an overview of graph theory to provide a solid understanding of the powerful graph data structure. You'll then learn about GraphQL types, as well as how to build a schema to describe your API. This book also includes an overview of Apollo and Relay, two popular frameworks that are used to connect GraphQL to your user interface. **},

abstract = {Zusammenfassung Im Zuge der Digitalisierung verschwimmt die Abgrenzung wertsch{\"{o}}pfender und unterst{\"{u}}tzender Prozesse immer weiter, wodurch eine Trans-formation von urspr{\"{u}}nglich nachgelagerten Prozessen zu einem ganzheitlichen Wertsch{\"{o}}pfungsnetzwerk erfolgt. Um sich dieser Entwicklung stellen zu k{\"{o}}nnen, ist es f{\"{u}}r Unternehmen unabdingbar, passende Informations-und Kommunikations-technik einzusetzen. Dabei existieren bereits mehrere Studien, die sich mit der The-matik der Digitalisierung in Deutschland besch{\"{a}}ftigen. Dabei wird oftmals jedoch nur auf den Digitalisierungsgrad der Unternehmen eingegangen. Dies erweiternd wurde eine Studie durchgef{\"{u}}hrt mit dem Ziel, die Einsch{\"{a}}tzung von KMU bezo-gen auf die Chancen, Risiken und auch auf den eigenen Digitalisierungsstand zu erhalten. Dazu wurden ca. 2300 in der Region Dresden ans{\"{a}}ssige KMU des verar-beitenden Gewerbes befragt. Auf Basis dieser Ergebnisse k{\"{o}}nnen R{\"{u}}ckschl{\"{u}}sse ge-zogen werden, welcher Informationsbedarf und Entwicklungsbedarf auf Seiten der KMU mit Blickpunkt Digitalisierung noch immer ben{\"{o}}tigt wird. Dabei wird in der Studie deutlich, dass noch erheblicher Handlungsbedarf besteht, um die Potenzia-le moderner IKT insbesondere in den Bereichen integrierter Anwendungssoftware, Unterst{\"{u}}tzung von Produktion und Logistik sowie Nutzung von Cloud-Diensten angemessen zu erschlie{\ss}en, da hier teilweise noch gro{\ss}e Hemmnisse auf Seiten der Unternehmen gesehen werden, die oftmals jedoch auch aus einem gewissen Unwissen {\"{u}}ber die Thematik der Digitalisierung resultieren.},

abstract = {Meetings and classrooms demand the presence of the person in the room if he wants to participate. A tool widely used in such places is a whiteboard. A whiteboard has limited creativity and interactivity options and hence it needs to be replaced with better tools. In this paper we develop a web application to increase collaboration without restricting him to any location, operating system platform or device. Our application allows users to interact and share information via drawings, images, chat, audio and video. They can create individual rooms and share the room id with only certain people. Users only need access to web browsers and internet to make use of the application. There is no limit on the number of users allowed to participate and no plug-in needs to be downloaded. We have implemented this system by using HTML5, Node.js and WebSocket. WebSocket support concurrency in real-time transmission of information. All the users can simultaneously interact with the system. The experimental results demonstrate the high scalability of our system. As evident from the experiments, the response delay is extremely low, the system is fast and provides real-time experience to the users.},

abstract = {This paper presents a design of an intelligent remote electrical power supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system based on the Internet of Things (IoT), with Internet Information Services (IIS) for setting up web servers, an ASP.NET model-view- controller (MVC) for establishing a remote electrical power monitoring and control system by using responsive web design (RWD), and a Microsoft SQL Server as the database. With the web browser connected to the Internet, the sensing data is sent to the client by using the TCP/IP protocol, which supports mobile devices with different screen sizes. The users can provide instructions immediately without being present to check the conditions, which considerably reduces labor and time costs. The developed system incorporates a remote measuring function by using a wireless sensor network and utilizes a visual interface to make the human-machine interface (HMI) more instinctive. Moreover, it contains an analog input/output and a basic digital input/output that can be applied to a motor driver and an inverter for integration with a remote SCADA system based on IoT, and thus achieve efficient power management.},

The node package manager (npm) serves as the frontend to a large repository of JavaScript-based software packages, which foster the development of currently huge amounts of server-side Node.js and client-side JavaScript applications. In a span of 6 years since its inception, npm has grown to become one of the largest software ecosystems, hosting more than 230, 000 packages, with hundreds of millions of package installations every week. In this paper, we examine the npm ecosystem from two complementary perspectives: 1) we look at package descriptions, the dependencies among them, and download metrics, and 2) we look at the use of npm packages in publicly available applications hosted on GitHub. In both perspectives, we consider historical data, providing us with a unique view on the evolution of the ecosystem. We present analyses that provide insights into the ecosystem's growth and activity, into conflicting measures of package popularity, and into the adoption of package versions over time. These insights help understand the evolution of npm, design better package recommendation engines, and can help developers understand how their packages are being used.},

This also means a web application can easily be converted to a native mobile application if desired. This allows software products to be evolved continuously at a much faster pace with features added on daily basis. The software companies who can adopt these technologies will most likely see the benefit in the long run as they can offer new and modified products faster than their competitors.

It is essential for the credibility of UX professionals that we show how our work affects the performance of our organizations by ensuring that their web analytics goals are aligned with user needs and then tying UX work to the improvement of these metrics. A major concept for effectively using Google Analytics is the conversion rate, the amount of users who successfully complete one of those strategically chosen actions divided by the total number of users in a population. By measuring how this rate changes over time we can understand how changes to a website affect users' ability to complete important actions.

@book{Subramanian2019,
abstract = {Mineralization rates of 14C-labeled substrates were determined in the presence and absence of Na2MoO4, an inhibitor of sulfate reduction, in the profundal sediments of a shallow eutrophic lake. Sulfate reduction was inhibited by Na2MoO4 at all concentrations tested (0.2 to 200 mM), whereas methane production was inhibited at Na2MoO4 concentrations greater than 20 mM. Initial mineralization rates of glucose were unaffected by Na2MoO4; however, Na2MoO4 decreased the mineralization rates of lactate (58{\%}), propionate (52{\%}), an amino acid mixture (85{\%}), and acetate (14{\%}). These decreases in the rates of mineralization were attributed to inhibition of sulfate reduction. Hydrogen stimulated the reduction of 35SO42− 2.5- to 2.8-fold, demonstrating potential hydrogen oxidation by sulfate-reducing bacteria. These results indicate that sulfate reducers utilize an array of substrates as electron donors and are of potential significance to the in situ mineralization of lactate, propionate, and free amino acids in these sediments.},

@inproceedings{wittern2018,
abstract = {GraphQL is a query language and thereupon-based paradigm for implementing web Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for client-server interactions. Using GraphQL, clients define precise, nested data-requirements in typed queries, which are resolved by servers against (possibly multiple) backend systems, like databases, object storages, or other APIs. Clients receive only the data they care about, in a single request. However, providers of existing REST(-like) APIs need to implement additional GraphQL interfaces to enable these advantages. We here assess the feasibility of automatically generating GraphQL wrappers for existing REST(-like) APIs. A wrapper, upon receiving GraphQL queries, translates them to requests against the target API. We discuss the challenges for creating such wrappers, including dealing with data sanitation, authentication, or handling nested queries. We furthermore present a prototypical implementation of OASGraph. OASGraph takes as input an OpenAPI Specification (OAS) describing an existing REST(-like) web API and generates a GraphQL wrapper for it. We evaluate OASGraph by running it, as well as an existing open source alternative, against 959 publicly available OAS. This experiment shows that OASGraph outperforms the existing alternative and is able to create a GraphQL wrapper for {\$}{\$}89.5$\backslash${\%}{\$}{\$}of the APIs -- however, with limitations in many cases. A subsequent analysis of errors and warnings produced by OASGraph shows that missing or ambiguous information in the assessed OAS hinders creating complete wrappers. Finally, we present a use case of the IBM Watson Language Translator API that shows that small changes to an OAS allow OASGraph to generate more idiomatic and more expressive GraphQL wrappers.},

abstract = {Includes index. Build fast, reliable web applications using the latest web development technologies. This book provides step-by-step learning through the process of transforming a "traditional" web app into a high-performing progressive web app, leveraging principles and lessons taught throughout the book. You will learn to improve the performance, reliability, reach, and user engagement of mobile web applications through the use of specific, practical examples. Because most non-trivial web applications developed today use JavaScript frameworks, you will learn about the most popular frameworks offering a PWA right out of the box, including React, Preact, Vue.js, Angular, and Ionic. You also will learn which tools to enlist to measure your applications performance, such as Googles Lighthouse. Beginning Progressive Web App Development includes best practices to make your app work even when an end user has a poor or no Internet connection, and to send notifications and reminders with the Notification and Push APIs to keep your users engaged. You will come away with an understanding of the technologies—application shells, server push technology, and caching—that will allow you to rapidly deliver content to your users. As important as it is to provide mobile users with a great experience, the principles of PWAs are not limited to smartphones. Most of what you will learn in this book is directly applicable to web applications on all screen sizes. What You'll Learn: Achieve nearly instant loading times Implement service workers to make your app load faster and work while users are offline Keep users engaged with web notifications Measure the performance and reach of your web applications Transform your existing web app into a progressive web app Create a progressive web app from scratch Understand what building a truly fast web app entails with Googles PRPL pattern This book is for web developers with prior JavaScript experience. Dennis Sheppard, VP of Technology at NextTier Education, has been developing web applications for more than 10 years in a variety of industries, including education, insurance, and finance. Much of his career has been focused on building apps that run on the mobile web.

abstract = {— Single Page Application (SPA) is composed of individual component that can be replaced or updated independently, without refreshing whole page so that the entire page does not need to be reloaded on each user action, which saves bandwidth as well as no loading of external files every time when page is loaded, such as images or CSS files, etc. The purpose behind this is to make the subsequent page loads very fast as compared to traditional Request-Response cycle. SPA's written by using JavaScript, HTML5, AJAX are getting the likes of developers to build their web applications and some frameworks like AngularJS which are built on top of the JavaScript are making the life of developers very easy. The idea behind using AngularJS in web application is to make your web application modular and easy to maintain. AngularJS brings MVC (Model View Controller) capability to your application. After using minified and compressed files in your application, the size reduces to some KBs which will results in faster loading of pages.},

We measured accessibility in two ways: the perceived accessibility as reported by participants and accessibility in terms of conformance to guidelines. Findings uncover that perceived Web accessibility is significantly correlated with 27 of the 35 UX attributes analysed, suggesting these two qualities are closely related. The relationship between UX and conformance to WCAG 2.0 is more elusive: we only found significant correlations between the hedonic attributes original, innovative and exciting.},

For real-time management system, there are some performance problems in the traditional Web service architecture based on REST style. In this paper,it proposes to establish GraphQL server in the real-time subsystem and integrate it into the existing systems.Through this architecture, the client can obtain the specified data from the server side, thus reducing the number of network requests and avoiding excessive capture or capture of data. Experiments are carried out in a real-time monitoring system. The experimental results show that the proposed architecture reduces the transmission data packets by 57.38{\%} in rea-time monitoring and management system, and reduces the average time of data transmission by 8.9{\%}},

abstract = {We examine the implications of end-to-end web application development, in the social web era. The paper describes a distributed architecture, suitable for modern web application development, as well as the interactivity components associated with it. Furthermore, we conducted a series of stress tests, on popular server side technologies. The PHP/Apache stack was found inefficient to address the increasing demand in network traffic. Nginx was found more than 2.5 times faster in input/output (I/O) operations than Apache, whereas Node.js outperformed both. Node.js, although excellent in I/O operations and resource utilization, was found lacking in serving static files using its built in HTTP server, while Nginx performed great at this task. So, in order to address efficiency, an Nginx server could be placed in-front and proxy static file requests, allowing the Node.js processes to only handle dynamic content. Such a configuration can offer a better infrastructure in terms of efficiency and scalability, replacing the aged PHP/Apache stack. Furthermore we have found that building cross platform applications based on web technologies, is both feasible and highly productive, especially when addressing stationary and mobile devices, as well as the fragmentation among them. Our study concludes that Node.js offers client-server development integration, aiding code reusability in web applications, and is the perfect tool for developing fast, scalable network applications. {\textcopyright} 2014 Springer-Verlag Wien.},

@book{Shivakumar2014,
abstract = {A robust software testing strategy is essential for bulletproofing an enterprise application and for a quality delivery within the planned cost and quality. We have seen some testing strategies specific to scalability, availability, and performance in previous chapters. This chapter complements those testing methodologies by elaborating on testing best practices and testing methodologies that can be adopted for testing enterprise web applications. Creating a rock-solid testing strategy is a creative and multi-dimensional effort requiring intricate knowledge of the domain, technology, and scenario in which the end user operates. With the emergence of various enterprise web technologies, traditional testing methods fall short of meeting various end-user expectations. This chapter focuses on the challenges with testing in general and web testing methods in particular. The chapter then lays out the critical success factors for a sound testing strategy in enterprise application testing. It provides novel end-to-end software testing methodologies, starting from the testing estimation model, up through postproduction for enterprise web applications. The key pillars of the testing strategy proposed in this chapter are based on user-centric, complete validation, automation, proactive problem detection and prevention and performance focus (the {\{}UCAPP{\}} model). The chapter provides sample testing metrics, testing processes, for implementation of proposed testing strategy. The chapter also provides detailed insights from comprehensive analysis of successfully implemented enterprise web applications, software testing trends, and best practices implemented successfully in large-scale enterprise projects to achieve high availability in enterprise applications. The chapter provides enterprise testing principles with a special focus on enterprise web scenarios. In previous chapters, we saw the testing processes, best practices, and techniques applicable for each of the quality attributes—scalability, availability, and performance. This chapter extends those concepts and covers the remaining aspects of testing such as testing principles, process, and techniques applicable to generic projects and enterprise web projects.},
